<h2 align="center">What is a phishing attack</h4>

<br>

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. 
It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. 
The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
An attack can have devastating results. 
For individuals, this includes unauthorised purchases, the stealing of funds, or identity theft.

<h3>Phishing techniques</h3>

<h4>Email phishing scams</h4>


Email phishing is a numbers game. 
An attacker sending out thousands of fraudulent messages can net significant information and sums of money, even if only a small percentage of recipients fall for the scam.


In addition, attackers will usually try to push users into action by creating a sense of urgency. 
For example, as previously shown, an email could threaten account expiration and place the recipient on a timer. 
Applying such pressure causes the user to be less diligent and more prone to error.

<h4>Spear phishing</h4>

Spear phishing targets a specific person or enterprise, as opposed to random application users. 
It’s a more in-depth version of phishing that requires special knowledge about an organisation, including its power structure.

An attack might play out as follows:

<ul>
  <li>A perpetrator researches names of employees within an organization’s marketing department and gains access to the latest project invoices.
</li>


<li>A link in the email redirects to a password-protected internal document, which is in actuality a spoofed version of a stolen invoice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to prevent phishing</h3>


Phishing attack protection requires steps be taken by both users and enterprises.

<br>

For enterprises, a number of steps can be taken to mitigate both phishing and spear phishing attacks:

<ul>
  <li>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is the most effective method for countering phishing attacks, as it adds an extra verification layer when logging in to sensitive applications. 
2FA relies on users having two things: something they know, such as a password and username, and something they have, such as their smartphones. Even when employees are compromised, 2FA prevents the use of their compromised credentials, since these alone are insufficient to gain entry.</li>
  <li>In addition to using 2FA, organisations should enforce strict password management policies. 
For example, employees should be required to frequently change their passwords and to not be allowed to reuse a password for multiple applications.</li>
  <li>Educational campaigns can also help diminish the threat of phishing attacks by enforcing secure practices, such as not clicking on external email links.</li>
</ul>
