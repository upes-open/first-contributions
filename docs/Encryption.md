## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the process of encoding a message in a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. 
Encryption helps us in protecting data that we send, receive , and store using a device. These data could be text messages or your banking account information sent through your online account.

## Types of Encryption
###  1. Asymmetric Encryption
It is also known as public-key encryption. In this type of encryption, encryption key (i.e. public key) and decryption key (i.e.private key) are different. 
The message encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key. 
Anyone can use the public key to encrypt messages for the receiver and only the receiver can decrypt them.

### 2. Symmetric Encryption
In this type of encryption , only one key is used to encrypt and decrypt  the message.
Here the data is converted in the form which cannot to understood by anyone who doesnâ€™t have key to decrypt it.

### What is key here?
An encryption key is a random string of bits created for altering data so that it appears random. 
It is created with algorithms designed to ensure that key is unpredictable. 

### Why data encryption necessary?

### Privacy
Encryption ensures that no one else can use the data except the receiver. 
This prevents, hackers , internet service provider or government from reading data.
### Security 
Encrypted communication enable the communication parties to exchange sensitive data without leaking the data.
### Data Integrity
Encryption prevent on-path attacks.When data is transmitted across the Internet, 
encryption ensures that the data receiver receives has not been tampered with on the way.
