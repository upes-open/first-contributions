Buffer is a term that is not specifically related to IT or CS. Let's talk about what buffer is in general and then we will concentrate it towards IT or CS.
In leyman term, Buffer is a temporary storage place. Buffer is created in order to mitigate differences between input speed and output speed.
While the producer is being faster than the consumer, the producer can continue to store output in the buffer.
When the consumer gets around to it, it can read from the buffer. The buffer is there in the middle to bridge the gap.
Now coming to CS or IT, the concept of Buffer remains same. Buffer is actually a chunk of memory used to store data temporarily. 
A reserved section of memory inside a software this is used to maintain the data being processed. 
Buffers are installation in each software to maintain data coming in and going out. 
In a video streaming utility, this system makes use of buffers to shop and strengthen deliver of video records to make amends for short-term delays or as called buffering. 
In a computer, every utility can allocate and deallocate its buffers from the overall memory pool. 
In a printer and different peripherals, constant buffers offer temporary storage for records passing through.
Let's get more clarity by undertaking the example of watching a movie online. 
So imagine if you're watching a movie online, the web services will continuously download the next 5-10 minutes of the movie and hold it into a buffer.
This makes sure that your computer doesn't have to downlaod the movie as you're watching it(which causes buffering).
