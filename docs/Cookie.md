## What are HTTP Cookies?

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a user's computer while they're visiting a particular website.

### Cookies can have several different functions

1. Track user's browsing activity: This is done in order serve up targeted information such as ads for goods, or services.
For Example: When you’re browsing Amazon for say colorful hair dyes, you will then see ads on Instagram later for the same from various available brands.

2. Remembering login details of a user for a specific website.

3. Cookies also allow website owners to track how many unique visitors are they getting on their website. As each cookie has its own unique ID, so if the a user visits the same website 2 or 3 times in a day, the cookie allows us to count this as one unique viewer. So website owners can collect more accurate data about their website traffic.

## How does a cookie work?

When a user visits a website for the first time, for example, an online store, the website will put a cookie on the computer’s hard drive, that will have a unique identification code.

The site then uses this ID to keep track of that user's “session”.

The reason it does this is so it can keep track of things like which items you’ve saved to your shopping cart, your wishlist or which items you’ve looked already at so it can suggest similar items, or even save coupon codes for you that can be used even if you close out of the website and come back to it later that day.
 
### Third Party Cookies

Let’s say you’re browsing a website that has a button to like or share on Facebook embedded into it. Well this button has to talk to facebook.com which now means that facebook can now send their own cookies through this website to see some of your activity, and use it to target ads specific for you next you’re scrolling down your Facebook news feed. 

But not all cookies are privacy breaching parasites and generally they can help you have a much more enjoyable browsing experience and save you lots of time and headache on the web.
