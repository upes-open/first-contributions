It is a small amount of faster, more expensive memory used to improve the performance of recently or frequently accessed data. Cached data is stored temporarily in an accessible storage media that's local to the cache client and separate from the main storage. Cache is commonly used by the central processing unit (CPU), applications, web browsers and operating systems.

Cache is used because bulk or main storage can't keep up with the demands of clients. Cache decreases data access times, reduces latency and improves input/output (I/O). Because almost all application workloads depend on I/O operations, the caching process improves application performance.

How does a cache work?
When a cache client attempts to access data, it first checks the cache. If the data is found there, that is referred to as a cache hit. The percent of attempts that result in a cache hit is called the cache hit rate or ratio.

Requested data that isn't found in the cache -- referred to as a cache miss -- is pulled from main memory and copied into the cache. How this is done, and what data is ejected from the cache to make room for the new data, depends on the caching algorithm, cache protocols and system policies being used.
