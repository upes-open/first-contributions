## What is Firewall?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters the incoming and outgoing content based on an organisation’s previously established security policies. It can essentially referred to as a barrier between a private internal network and public internet.  It filters out the threatening content to keep away from the dangerous traffic. 

## Types of Firewalls
- Packet Filtering
    - A small amount of data is analysed and distributed according to the filter’s standards.
- Proxy Service 
    - Network security system that protects while filtering messages at the application layer.
- Stateful Inspection
    - Dynamic packet filtering that monitors active connections to determine which network packets to allow through the Firewall.
- Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
    - Deep packet inspection Firewall with application-level inspection.

## What is the purpose of a Firewall?

A Firewall is a necessary part of any security architecture and takes the guesswork out of host level protections and entrusts them to your network security device. Firewalls, and especially Next Generation Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks, along with an integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS), these Next Generation Firewalls can react quickly and seamlessly to detect and react to outside attacks across the whole network. They can set policies to better defend your network and carry out quick assessments to detect invasive or suspicious activity, like malware, and shut it down.
