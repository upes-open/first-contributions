# Cache

A cache is a reserved storage location that collects temporary data to help websites, browsers, and apps load faster. 
Whether it's a computer, laptop or phone, web browser or app, you'll find some variety of a cache.

A cache makes it easy to quickly retrieve data, which in turn helps devices run faster. 
It acts like a memory bank, making it easy to access data locally instead of redownloading it every time you visit a website or open an app.

Caches are found in both software and hardware. 
The CPU, or central processing unit — the core component responsible for processing information from the software in your desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet — has its own cache.
