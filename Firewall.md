## **1. What is Firewall?**
- A **firewall** is a **network security** device that monitors and **filters incoming and outgoing network traffic** according to security regulations set by an organisation.
-  A firewall, is a **barrier that separates a private internal network from the public Internet**.

<br>

## **2. Firewall protects our network against:**
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Hackers who try variations of usernames and passwords to discover login credentials.
- **Malware:** Attacks where **device, network or server** is infected with malware.
- **DDoS:** Attacks where thousands or millions of **fake packets are send on server** to overload it and **take the webservice/website down**.

<br>

## **3. What if Firewall did not exist?**
- **Free Public access:** Without a firewall **anyone can access** the networks and the **owner will have no way to monitor or neutralize the attacks taking place**.
- **Downtime on the internet:** Anyone can perform a **DDoS Attack** on your network and can take the site down.
- **User Data access:** In today's time it is said that **data is the new oil**, which means data is very important. But, without a firewall **anyone can access the data and release it into public**. 

<br>

## **4. Are Firewalls enough to protect networks?**
- **NO** the firewalls are not enough. They **may be secure** but they have their own **vulnerabilities** which can be utilized to grant access to the network.
- So with such emerging new technology we can't say we are secure.
